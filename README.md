# CUDA MeanShift
## A simple implementation of MeanShift algorithm with CUDA.

In this repo the parallel version of Mean Shift algorithm is presented; this repo belongs to the Master Degree Parallel Computing course project at UNIFI; here the link to its [sequential version](https://github.com/pisalore/MeanShift_sequentialCPP). Here the related [paper](https://github.com/pisalore/MeanShift_CUDA/blob/master.
